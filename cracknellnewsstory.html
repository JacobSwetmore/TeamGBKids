            victorious <br>Cracknell makes Boat Race <br>history.</h1>
        <img class="news-hero" src="images/cracknell.jpg" alt="James Cracknell">
        <p>It is almost 20 years since James Cracknell won the first of his two Olympic golds.
            <br><br>

                But the rower proved he has lost none of his competitive spirit or undoubted class by making history at
                the 165th Boat Race.
                <br><br>
                The 46-year-old, who became the race’s oldest-ever competitor, played a key part as Cambridge won in 16
                minutes 57 seconds – two seconds ahead of rivals Oxford.
                <br><br>
                “At the start I thought: ‘I’ve missed this’,” he said. “The first few minutes were great but they just
                didn’t drop. It was a humdinger all the way! It maybe wasn’t a 10/10 performance but it was pretty much
                an eight or a nine.
                “If I had any doubt, it would have been my sprinting. I just made sure I stuck it in and hopefully, we
                had enough in the bank.”
                <br><br>
                Cracknell won two Olympic golds in the men’s four, firstly in 2000 alongside Steve Redgrave, Matthew
                Pinsent and Tim Foster.
                <br><br>
                And then he repeated the feat in Athens four years later, along with Pinsent, Steve Williams and Alex
                Partridge.
                <br><br>
                Cracknell, who is studying a Masters in human evolution, retired from rowing in 2006 and has since
                undertaken adventures for charity – including a 1400-mile trip from Britain to Africa where he only
                rowed, cycled and swam.
                <br><br>

                But, after starting his degree, the most famous boat race was in the world was too tempting to ignore.
                “Although I look quite fit and athletic, it’s just a lot less powerful,” he said.
                <br><br>

                “My legs are much thinner. Seventy per cent of the power in rowing comes from the legs and the shoulders
                – everything looks like I’ve had the water sucked out of me.
                <br><br>

                “I know what I weighed on the morning of the Olympics in 2004, and that was 95.7kg (15st 1lb). And then,
                at the Boat Race weigh-in I was 89kg (14st).
                <br><br>

                “That is effectively a stone of muscle, really, which is quite useful in rowing.”
                <br><br>

                Cambridge controlled the race from the off and, despite a brief wobble, eased home by five lengths.</p>
